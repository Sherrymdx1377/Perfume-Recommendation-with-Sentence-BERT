# Perfume-Recommendation-with-Sentence-BERT

# Description:
This repository hosts a guided project on building a perfume recommendation system using Sentence-BERT. As a Data Scientist working for a fragrance retailer aiming to enhance online sales, this project leverages the power of Sentence-BERT to transform perfume notes into semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. The embeddings are then utilized to compute similarities between perfumes and create a robust recommender system.

# Project Overview:

Objective: Design and implement a perfume recommender system based on the similarity of perfume notes.

Key Features:

1. Utilizes Sentence-BERT for generating semantically meaningful sentence embeddings.
2. Computes similarities between perfume notes using cosine-similarity metrics.
3. Implements a perfume recommender system that suggests five perfumes with notes similar to the user's most recent search.

# Project Flow:

1. Introduction to Sentence-BERT: Understand the working mechanics of Sentence-BERT.

2. Computing Sentence Embeddings: Use Python's sentence-transformers framework to compute embeddings.

3. Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Analysis: Analyze semantic similarity between sentence embeddings.

4. Building the Recommender System: Develop a perfume recommender system based on computed similarities.

# Requirements:

1. Basic understanding of BERT and Transformers.

2. Familiarity with Pandas for data manipulation.

3. Experience with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualization.
